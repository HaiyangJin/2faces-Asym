## Abstract

Holistic face processing is typically measured by the part-whole task (PW), standard composite face task (SCF), and complete composite face task (CCF); nevertheless, these paradigms do not seem to test the same construct and the potential distinctive aspects remain elusive. Here we investigate the nature of facilitation and interference observed in congruent and incongruent trials in the CCF, respectively. These two aspects are asymmetrically influenced by the target facial half and by cueing probabilities. This evidence suggests that there are at least two asymmetric faces of holistic face processing: facilitation and interference. The PW and SCF are likely to test facilitation and interference respectively as well. Our findings bring the opportunity to consider previous mixed findings examined by different paradigms into one unified framework.
