## Abstract

A hallmark of face specificity is holistic processing. It is typically measured by paradigms such as the part-whole and composite tasks. However, these tasks show little evidence for common variance, so a comprehensive account of holistic processing remains elusive. One aspect that varies between tasks is whether they measure facilitation or interference from holistic processing. In this study, we examined facilitation and interference in a single paradigm to determine the way in which they manifest during a face perception task. Using congruent and incongruent trials in the complete composite face task, we found that these two aspects are asymmetrically influenced by the location and cueing probabilities of the target facial half, suggesting that they operate somewhat independently. We argue that this perspective has the potential to disentangle mixed findings from different popular paradigms measuring holistic processing in one unified framework.
